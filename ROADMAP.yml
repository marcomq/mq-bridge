      id: "D7"
      description: |
        Create a new crate `mq-bridge-encryption` that depends on `mq-bridge`.
        Implement `CustomMiddlewareFactory` in the new crate to handle message encryption/decryption configuration and logic.
        This serves as a proof-of-concept for the custom middleware registry (D6).
