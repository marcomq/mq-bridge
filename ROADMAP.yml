    - title: "Avoid redundant Subscribers and Consumers"
      id: "A3"
      description: |
        IBM MQ and Kafka for example have Subscriber and Consumer mode. However, this is not
        really relevant here as the mode is configured by topic and queues. Lets remove the endpoint mode 
        and add one to the configuration if necessary and not implicit.

    - title: "Avoid using new... with additional parameters"
      id: "A4"
      description: |
        Most interfaces have "new" with topic or queue. This shouldn't be necessary at all.
        We just need a "new" with just the Configuration as parameters. So we would need to move the parameters
        from "new" to the configuration

    - title: "Easier API"
      id: "A5"
      description: |
        Currently, there are helpers that have static functions like Publisher::register.
        We should use only a single file to make it easier for the end user to find all available helpers.

    - title: "Add encryption middleware as separate crate"
      id: "D7"
      description: |
        Create a new crate `mq-bridge-encryption` that depends on `mq-bridge`.
        Implement `CustomMiddlewareFactory` in the new crate to handle message encryption/decryption configuration and logic.
        This serves as a proof-of-concept for the custom middleware registry (D6).

    - title: "OpenTelemetry Context Propagation"
      id: "E8"
      description: |
        Implement middleware to extract and inject W3C Trace Context (Traceparent) headers from/to message metadata.
        This enables distributed tracing across microservices connected via the bridge.

    - title: "Explicit Nack Support"
      id: "F10"
      description: |
        Update `MessageConsumer` trait and `CommitFunc` to support explicit Negative Acknowledgement (Nack).
        This allows consumers to reject messages (e.g., on serialization failure) and have the broker redeliver or DLQ them immediately,
        instead of waiting for a timeout or connection drop.

    - title: "SQL Endpoint (sqlx)"
      id: "G11"
      description: |
        Implement a generic SQL endpoint using `sqlx` supporting Postgres, MySQL, and SQLite.
        Consumer: Poll table based on cursor (id/timestamp) or queue-like (lock/delete).
        Publisher: Insert message payload/metadata into table.
