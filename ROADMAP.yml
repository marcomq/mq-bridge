        Breaking Change: Refactor `EndpointType::Custom` to store a config struct (type_name + serde_json::Value) instead of a factory trait object.
        Update `EndpointVisitor` deserialization to fallback to `EndpointType::Custom` when encountering unknown keys in the config map.
        Implement a global `EndpointRegistry` (singleton) to register `CustomEndpointFactory` implementations by name.
        Resolve the factory at runtime during Route initialization to instantiate the actual endpoint.

      id: "D5"
      description: |
        Breaking Change: Remove `IbmMq` variant from `EndpointType` in `mq-bridge` core.
        Create a new crate `mq-bridge-ibm-mq` that depends on `mq-bridge`.
        Implement `CustomEndpointFactory` in the new crate to handle IBM MQ configuration and initialization.
        This serves as a proof-of-concept for the plugin system (D4).

      description: |
        Breaking Change: Refactor `Middleware::Custom` to store a config struct (type_name + serde_json::Value) instead of a factory trait object.
        Implement custom `Deserialize` logic for `Middleware` to map unknown keys to `Middleware::Custom`.
        Implement a global `MiddlewareRegistry` to register `CustomMiddlewareFactory` implementations.
        Resolve the factory at runtime to instantiate the middleware.

    - title: "Add encryption middleware as separate crate"
      id: "D7"
      description: |
        Create a new crate `mq-bridge-encryption` that depends on `mq-bridge`.
        Implement `CustomMiddlewareFactory` in the new crate to handle message encryption/decryption configuration and logic.
        This serves as a proof-of-concept for the custom middleware registry (D6).
